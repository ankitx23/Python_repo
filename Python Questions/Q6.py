# Exercise 6: Display numbers divisible by 5
# Write a Python code to display numbers from a list divisible by 5

# Given list is  [10, 20, 33, 46, 55]
# Divisible by 5
# 10
# 20
# 55


# y=[10, 20, 33, 46, 55]

# for i in y:
#     if i%5==0:
#         print(f" {i} is divisible by 5")
#     else:
#         print (f" {i} is not divisble by 5")

a=110
for i in range(0,11):
    if i%2==0:
        print(i)
        pass
    else:
        print(i)

print(a)
